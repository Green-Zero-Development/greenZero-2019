###### Discovery
## How can we improve FEMAC's web experience?
&nbsp;

FEMAC Security Solutions was one of greenZero's first clients and a bit of a different case from what was to come in the following years. FEMAC has never requested editing access and prefers to lean on greenZero's expertise for updating their website's content. We decided to use this unique arrangement to maximize hosting savings and streamline the developer experience on FEMAC's website. All of the techniques and methods used to achieve these goals would go on to define greenZero's approach to web development - and would contribute to our focus on customer savings for future projects.

###### Reasonable hosting costs
## Website hosting can be affordable and reliable
&nbsp;

FEMAC was the first client to benefit from the JAMstack workflow that greenZero uses to deliver maximum value to our customers. femacsecuritysolutions.com is built using [goHugo](https://gohugo.io/) and served via [Netlify CDN](https://www.netlify.com/). Because only flat HTML files are served, FEMAC's website benefits from fast load times, better baseline security and scalable hosting costs. \
\
At current visitor numbers, FEMAC spends pennies per month on hosting. With scalability built in, they could make national headlines and still serve the same website to millions of visitors in a day. They'd *pay* a fair price for those visitors, but (more importantly) their site won't go dark when the spotlight is on. Hosting infrastructure that isn't concerned with scalability runs the risk of charging too much in the down months and not following through on stability when the customer needs it the most. \

###### Partner with a developer
## Ensure your website is flexible and continues to serve your business's needs
&nbsp;

With lots of website building services available on the market, it's easier than ever to build your own website from scratch. Often, creating something striking with these website builders isn't too difficult. Drag-and-drop editors have become the norm and just about anyone with an understanding of basic web UI can put together a website project they can be proud of. \
\
However, what a website builder gives in usability it loses in flexibility. In an effort to standardize and improve the tools used by their customers, the companies that build drag-and-drop interfaces strip out capabilities that are either too confusing or not user-friendly. This almost always results in a website that cannot expand to use a particular tool or service. If this happens to you, with your entire site built using the drag-and-drop service, you're put in a position where you either abandon the service you wanted support for, or move off of the website builder service all together. This costs you money and (more importantly) time.\
\
FEMAC understood the limits of the drag-and-drop service they built their original site with. The service was everything they needed right up until the day it wasn't. greenZero built FEMAC a website that was 100% theirs to own and had a developer experience which only required skills most web developers were already familiar with.
