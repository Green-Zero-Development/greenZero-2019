###### Discovery
## What did the client need help with?
&nbsp;

OnPoint Custom Homes was suffering from long load times that annoyed and drove away customers who were landing on their site via the company's marketing efforts. They needed a fix and they needed it fast. greenZero was brought on to figure out how to speed up the site while keeping all of the important editing power OPCH had with their existing backend. \
\
OPCH had a robust backend - they needed a spot to edit and update their existing portfolio of home builds, a place to showcase remodel efforts, editable staff pages, testimonials, blog posts and more. And all of these needed to be rolled up into a package that was quick on the load.

###### Keeping essential editing tools
## A CMS that delivers speed and flexibility
&nbsp;

OPCH needed a full featured CMS solution that would give them the freedom to handle day-to-day edits. To allow for maximum speed, we opted to build OPCH's site from the ground up using the JAMstack. Our choice of headless CMS provider was [ForestryIO](https://forestry.io/), and we were pleased to have satisfied the editing needs of OPCH using this service. \

Included in OPCH's dashboard were all the tools they needed to keep their site's content current. greenZero used ForestryIO together with Github and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deliver an editing experience for OPCH that was both developer friendly and user friendly. \
\
Using these tools, both development efforts and content edits take less time to make. Going forward, this will save OnPoint Custom Homes money spent on development work AND time spent training new staff to update the website. \
\
Additionally, should OPCH have the need for another editable area on their website, a new toolbar can be built using the same technology used to build the site. They'll be no need to use third party plugins.

###### Speed up website
## Optimizing an existing site for faster page load
&nbsp;

JAMstack websites are built with speed in mind from conception, but greenZero took additional steps to ensure that OnPoint Custom Homes had the fastest website possible. Through use of services like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), we paid special attention to image optimization to shave off every possible second from OPCH's load time. \
\
Proper image handling is an essential part of any web optimization effort - this was especially true of OnPoint Custom Homes. They are an image heavy site. We decided it was best to serve OPCH's images from Cloudinary to take advantage of on-demand image transformations. This allows the OPCH site to serve photos at various sizes depending on context. This way, we didn't have to store tiny images of all of their floor plans or portfolio mockups, they could be generated and served on the fly. \
\
This particular effort resulted in the bulk of the load savings that the final product would bring to OnPoint Custom Homes. **They went from loading 15s + on their portfolio pages to just under 3s.** Additional savings were made via CSS optimizations, cutting back on JS and other efforts like minification. However, image optimization was king for OPCH. We're glad to help them implement a strategy that solved that bottleneck.
