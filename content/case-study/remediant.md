###### Discovery
## What was causing trouble?
&nbsp;

When greenZero was brought on to help the project, Remediant was wrestling with their previous content management system. The CMS solution wasn't particulary *bad* (it had all of the tools you'd expect from a CMS), but it forced Remediant to adhere to design and development standards the company wasn't comfortable with. \
\
The endgame was definitely to transition off of Remediant's constricting CMS solution, but before any work could be done we had to agree on three important things. The website had to be fast, secure and not be a pain in the butt to edit. Luck was on our side - greenZero could deliver on all three.

###### Improved editing experience
## A CMS for editing JUST what you need
&nbsp;

Most CMS solutions on the market have a fatal flaw - they overwhelm the user with options they either don't need now or don't need at all. Remediant handed us a list of things they wanted to edit themselves. We got to work. \
\
When shopping CMS providers for Remediant, we wanted to find a backend that would give everything the client needed to edit the things they *wanted* to edit. The idea was to remove unessessary fluff and allow Remediant to quickly and effectely edit their website's content. We found what they needed with ForestyIO. \

With help from a configurable sidebar and the content catorgazation allowed by goHugo (the website builder we use), Remediant's backend ended up including just what they needed to edit. There was room for Posts, Press releases, Career posting and everything else Remediant wanted to edit - nothing more and nothing less. \
\
Unlike most other CMS providers, this one wasn't bogged down with extras that were confusing or cumbersome. And, perhaps even better, this CMS edited static html files directly instead of relying on a server to do the heavy lifting. That tidbit allowed greenZero to deliver a fast and secure project.

###### Strenghtened security of site
## Reducing opprunities for website attack
&nbsp;

A website provider worth its salt will explain to any client that no website is 100% secure. Removing attack surfaces is one way of ensuring that a website is *more* safe for its users. For Remediant's site, we decided to use a static site generator to create the website's files and serve those files via a CDN. This workflow is generally referred to as the JAMstack and towts the benefit of being an effective way of securing a website from the ground up. \
\
Since JAMstack websites don't need servers involved to render pages, there is one less avenue of attack to be used by potential hackers. It's important to understand that this didn't make Remediant's site *immune* to attack - greenZero was adament in explaining that clearly. However, Remediant was satisfied with the protections the JAMstack did provide, and directly sought out to use the JAMstack in their project for this reason.

###### Created a fast website
## Building a website for *speed*
&nbsp;

Websites should be fast by design - there's never a reason to compromise on speed. Server reliant CMS options like Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal can be maticulaly optimized for speed, and there's folks who have made a living off doing just that. For Remediant, there was no need to optimize server-side code to make their website fast. By building on the JAMstack, greenZero was able to deliver a quick website experience out of the box. \
\
Of course, any developer that finds it easy to check off "optimize the website" from the list is doing one or two things wrong. Website optimization is an ongoing process that involves research of emerging technology and the use of that technology to improve an already fast product. There's a reason why sites built and left alone need to be re-developed every few years. Remediant understood the need to keep an ear to the ground on new tech, and trusted greenZero to keep them updated on webdev trends and help implement those that would benefit remediant.com
