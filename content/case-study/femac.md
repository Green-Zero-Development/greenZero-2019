###### Discovery
## How can we improve FEMAC's web experience?
&nbsp;

FEMAC Security Solutions was one of greenZero's first clients and a bit of a different case from what was to come in the following years. FEMAC has never requested editing access and prefers to lean on greenZero's expertise for updating their website's content. We decided to use this unique arrangment to maximize hosting savings and streamline the developer experience on FEMAC's website. All of the techniques and methods used to achieve these goals would go on to define greenZero's approach to web development - and would contribute to our focus on customer savings for future projects.

###### Reasonable hosting costs
## Website hosting can be affordable and reliable
&nbsp;

FEMAC was the first client to benefit from the JAMstack workflow that greenZero uses to deliver maximum value to our customers. femacsecuritysolutions.com is built using goHugo and served via Netlify CDN. Because only flat HTML files are served, FEMAC's website benefits from fast load times, better baseline security and scalable hosting costs. \
\
At current visitor numbers, FEMAC spends pennies per month on hosting. With scalability built in, they could make national headlines and still serve the same website to millions of visitors in a day. They'd *pay* a fair price for those visitors, but (more importantly) their site won't go dark when the spotlight is on. Hosting infrastructure that isn't concerned with scalebility runs the risk of charging too much in the down months and not following through on stability when the customer needs it the most. \

OPCH needed a full featured CMS solution that would give them the freedom to handle day-to-day edits. To allow for maximum speed, we opted to build OPCH's site from the ground up using the JAMstack. Our choice of headless CMS provider was ForestryIO, and we were pleased to have satified the editing needs of OPCH using this service. \

Included in OPCH's dashboard were all the tools they needed to keep their site's content current. greenZero used ForestryIO together with Github and Netlify to deliver an editing experience for OPCH that was both developer friendly and user friendly. \
\
Using these tools, both development efforts and content edits take less time to make. Going forward, this will save OnPoint Custom Homes money spent on development work AND time spent training new staff to update the website. \
\
Additionally, should OPCH have the need for another editable area on their website, a new toolbar can be built using the same technology used to build the site. They'll be no need to use third party plugins.

###### Sped up website
## Optimizing an existing site for faster page load
&nbsp;

JAMstack websites are built with speed in mind from conception, but greenZero took additional steps to ensure that OnPoint Custom Homes had the fastest website possible. Through use of services like Cloudinary, we paid special attention to image optimization to shave off every possible second from OPCH's load time. \
\
Proper image handling is an essential part of any web optimization effort - this was especially true of OnPoint Custom Homes. They are an image heavy site. We decided it was best to serve OPCH's images from Cloudinary to take advantage of on-demand image transformations. This allows the OPCH site to serve photos at various sizes depending on context. This way, we didn't have to store tiny images of all of their floor plans or portfolio mockups, they could be generated and served on the fly! \
\
This particular effort resulted in the bulk of the load savings that the final product would bring to OnPoint Custom Homes. **They went from loading 15s + on their portfolio pages to just under 3s.** Additional savings were made via CSS optimizations, cutting back on JS and other efforts like minification. However, image optimization was king for OPCH. We're glad to help them implement a strategy that solved that bottleneck.
